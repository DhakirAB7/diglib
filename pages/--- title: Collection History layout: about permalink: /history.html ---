##  ***Student Activism and The Arrival of Herman Hudson***   

Though this visual narrative centers on Herman Hudson's role in being the founding Chancellor for Afro-Affairs in 1970  
as well as the founding chair of the deparment of Afro-American Studies,both of which greatly helped to change the face of Indiana University,  
this digital collection also highlights the pivotal role that Black student activists played in being the fundemental initators 
of the insitutional shifts and conditions that created a space for Hudson to occupy those novel positions with their attendant affordances. 
As such student voices are moved to the fore here through student publications, newspaper clippings and more.  
The Black Studies deparment emerged out of two important occurances: Black Student activism and the arrival of Hudson at IU in 1968. 
Thus, it proves valuable to provide some biographical information on Hudson and how he came to IU and primary sources 
depicting Black student activism. This is the bedrock of the entire collection.
