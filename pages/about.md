## About the Collection

This digital collection of materials as it stands is a launching pad to an eventual larger project which will seek to foreground history which chronicles Herman C. Hudson’s role as Vice Chancellor of Afro-American Affairs, specifically from the years 1970-1975, where he helped to create a unique and academically sound Black Studies department through administrative savvy and institution building. Particularly, he founded the department of African American, the Black Culture Center, and the African American Arts Institute between the years 1970-1975. Strategically he insured that all of the former institutions were linked in a mutually supporting “academic triumvirate’ that was deeply entrenched into the University’s structure and substantially resistant to academic dismantle. The evidence of the effectiveness of this triumvirate is made manifest by the fact that all of those institutions stand today, and all have celebrated approximately, and in the case of the department, beyond 50 years of existence. On this background, at this time, this project seeks to provide a visual narrative of the ways in which Hudson became the first Vice Chancellor for Afro-American Affairs in 1970 while simultaneously becoming the founding chair of the then Afro-American Studies department. It is the author's hope to preserve this important history through the digital sphere as an open educational resource which will make this history more accessible to those within and beyond the university walls. In providing this visual journey, the author places primary sources from different repositories in conversation with each other. For example, materials utilized were discovered at the Indiana University Archives, the Lilly Library, the Neal-Marshall Black Culture Center Archives and more in an effort to provide a more robust story of the aforestated happenings
